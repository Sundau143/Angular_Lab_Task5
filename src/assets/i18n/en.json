        "title": "Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant",
        "description": "The date of foundation of the plant is considered to be 1863. In 1908, the company was founded, which later became the Melitopol Motor Plant (MeMZ). In 1923, the former Abraham Coop plant was renamed the Communar. In 1960, the Melitopol Motor Plant began to supply its engines to the Zaporozhye Automobile Plant. Since 1975, MeMZ has become a part of the production association 'AvtoZAZ'. Today it is one of the structural elements of PJSC 'ZAZ'. In 1961 the plant was renamed 'Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant'. The plant was engaged in the production of a single car - ZAZ-965, which went down in history as a 'humpbacked Zaporozhets'. JV 'AvtoZAZ-DEU' (since January 2003 - CJSC 'ZAZ') in the form of a closed joint stock company was established on April 15, 1998 on the production base of JSC 'Avtozaz'. The authorized capital was formed at the expense of the founders' contributions: from OJSC Avtozaz - property in the amount equivalent to $150; from Daewoo Motors - $150 million. In addition to the main enterprise in Zaporizhia, the joint venture also included the Melitopol Motor Plant (Fracturing Plant AvtoZAZ-Motor), the Black Sea Plant of Automobile Units (Fracturing Plant ChZAA), and the Pologi Plant Iskra (Fracturing Plant Iskra) as self-supporting enterprises. Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motors in 2001, UkrAvto bought AvtoZAZ in 2002. All production facilities of AvtoZAZ (primarily MeMZ and the Black Sea Motor Plant) were transformed into ZAZ. The company has even adopted a new logo. Daewoo's stake (50%) in the joint venture was bought by the Swiss company Hirsch & CIE in 2003. PJSC 'ZAZ' is now the only company in Ukraine that has a full cycle of passenger car production, which includes stamping, welding, painting, body equipment and car assembly. The plant has created and is constantly improving a qualitatively new modern high-tech production that meets the requirements of the international standard ISO 9001 version 2000."
